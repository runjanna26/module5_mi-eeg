 HOMEWORK PART 1 -- BUILD YOUR OWN PREPROCESSING PIPELINE  (BCIC2a)
=============================================================================

Your job in this file is to turn *raw* BCI Competition IV-2a MI-EEG trials
into the feature tensors that your model in `mixnet/models/HWNet.py`
will be trained on.

WHAT IS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU (do not change unless you know why):
  * reading + cropping the raw .mat files              -> `_load_bcic2a()`
  * the 5-fold subject-dependent cross-validation loop -> `subject_dependent_setting()`
  * saving the .npy files with the exact file names    -> `_save_data_with_valset()`
    that `mixnet.utils.DataLoader` expects

WHAT YOU MUST IMPLEMENT (the two `TODO` functions below):
  1. `fit_transform()` -- learn any data-driven parameters on the TRAINING
     fold only, and return the transformed training features.
  2. `transform()`     -- apply the *already learned* parameters to the
     validation / test folds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE GOLDEN RULE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Anything that *LEARNS* from data (CSP filters, PCA, a mean/std scaler, a
 whitening matrix, a channel-selection criterion, ...) must be fitted on the
 TRAINING fold ONLY, then merely *applied* to validation and test data.
 Fitting on all the data first and splitting afterwards is data leakage: it
 silently inflates your accuracy and makes the benchmark against MixNet
 meaningless. Marks are deducted for leakage.

 Stateless operations (band-pass filtering, cropping, resampling, log of the
 variance, ...) are safe to apply to every split independently.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data you receive in `fit_transform` / `transform`
    X : np.ndarray, shape (n_trials, n_channels, n_samples)
        n_channels = len(sel_chs)              (20 by default, see config.py)
        n_samples  = MI_len * pick_smp_freq    (4 s * 100 Hz = 400 by default)
    y : np.ndarray, shape (n_trials,)  with values in {0, 1}
        0 = left hand, 1 = right hand

Data you must return
    X_out : np.ndarray, shape (n_trials, ...anything you like...)
        Keep the trial axis first. Whatever trailing shape you choose decides
        the `input_shape` of your model: `DataLoader` reshapes it according to
        `data_format`, and the result minus the trial axis is what your
        network receives. The driver below prints the shape after every fold
        -- note it down, you need it in `experiments/configs/HWNet.py`. See
        the data_format table in that file.
